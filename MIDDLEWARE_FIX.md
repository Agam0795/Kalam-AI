# ðŸ”§ Middleware Runtime Error - FIXED

## Problem
```
Runtime Error: The Middleware "/middleware" must export a `middleware` or a `default` function
```

## Root Cause
Next.js was expecting a middleware file at `src/middleware.ts` but the file either didn't exist or didn't export the required function properly.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Minimal Middleware File
Created `src/middleware.ts` with a simple pass-through middleware:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

// Minimal middleware - just pass through all requests
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.next();
}

// Only apply to specific paths if needed
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip internal Next.js paths
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

### 2. Key Features of the Fix
- **Minimal Impact**: The middleware simply passes through all requests without modification
- **Proper Export**: Exports the required `middleware` function that Next.js expects
- **Path Matching**: Configured to skip internal Next.js paths to avoid unnecessary processing
- **TypeScript Compatible**: Properly typed with Next.js types

### 3. Why This Works
- Next.js automatically detects middleware files in the `src/` directory
- The middleware function signature matches Next.js requirements
- The `NextResponse.next()` allows all requests to continue normally
- The matcher configuration optimizes performance by skipping static assets

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

The middleware error has been completely resolved. The application will now start without the runtime error.

## Alternative Solutions

If you don't need middleware functionality at all, you could also:

1. **Remove middleware entirely** - But Next.js might still expect it based on configuration
2. **Use a more specific matcher** - To only apply middleware to certain routes
3. **Add actual middleware logic** - If you need authentication, redirects, or other middleware features in the future

## Future Enhancements

This minimal middleware can be extended to add:
- Authentication checks
- Request logging
- Rate limiting
- Redirects and rewrites
- Custom headers
- Analytics tracking

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for any future middleware needs.
